# Brain tissue segmentation with Unet using TPU

This data was obtained from MR images ,then annotated and augmented. Binary masks contain only brain tissue, excluding the tumor tissue.<br>

I have used the following methods.<br>
- Unet architecture with elu activation function<br>
- Dice coefficient implementation<br>
- The project took place using Google TPU<br>

## Results <br>
- This model have achived 0.88 validation Dice Coefficient.
