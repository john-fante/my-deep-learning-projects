## Mammals Classification w/Ensemble Deep Learning

First of all, I am very keen on trying new methods. This is why I tried an Ensemble Deep Learning method in this project. I impressed an article named "HCF: A Hybrid CNN Framework for Behavior Detection of Distracted Drivers" in this project [1]. In this technique, first I used 2 pretrained models (Xception, and DenseNet201). Then saved models and weights for using in the ensemble model. At this stage, I combined the 2 models with the GlobalAveragePooling2D layer outputs (as in the article). In conclusion, there is a lightly improvement in respect of the model's accuracy and F1 score.

I have used the following methods.

* The project took place using <b>Google TPU</b>,
* Used <b>tf.data</b> for input pipeline,
* I split the full data into train, validation and test sets,
* Used <b>tf.data</b> for input pipeline,
