## Sport Scene Classification w/ViT (3 KFold CV) 

(kaggle link -> https://www.kaggle.com/code/banddaniel/sport-scene-classification-w-vit-3-kfold-cv)

I have used the following methods.

* I tried to implementation of distributed deep learning strategy,
* I used a pretrained ViT model [1],
* Used <b>tf.data</b> for input pipeline,
* 3 KFold cross validation,
