<i><b><span style="color:#e74c3c;"> Note: Of course, there are other models better than my model in respect of the classification metrics, but I tried to a basic implementation of a paper. </span> </b></i>


First of all, I am very keen on trying new methods. This is why I tried <b>a Future Extractor with Feature Fusion method</b> in this project. I impressed an article named "HCF: A Hybrid CNN Framework for Behavior Detection of Distracted Drivers" in this project [1]. In this technique, first I used 2 pretrained models (EfficientNet v2 and MobileNet v2). At this stage, the 2 models are concatenated with feature outputs (as in the article). Then a dense layer for reducing the dimension as the model output. Finally, I applied PCA and classified with an SVC model. In conclusion, there is a lightly improvement in respect of the model's accuracy and F1 score. 

**I tried to fine-tune the models, but there is no considerable betterment in respect of the F1 score.**

* Used <b>mirrored strategy</b>,
* Used <b>tf.data</b> for input pipeline,
* I used an SVC model (with radial basis function kernel) for classification,
